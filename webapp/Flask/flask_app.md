# Flask Web App Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation provides instructions on how to set up and use the Flask web app for predicting whether a mother is healthy or not.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Flask web app, you'll need to have the following:

- Python 3.10.7
- Flask 2.0.1
- Other necessary packages (list them here)

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Santhusha-bit/pregma_unity.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd pregma_unity
```

3. Create a virtual environment for the project:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment:

for linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
for windows
```powershell
cd venv\Sricpts
5. Install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

To use the Flask web app, follow these steps:

1. Start the Flask app:

```bash

4. The model in the backend will predict whether the mother is healthy or not and return the result.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ You have successfully set up the project to start building the project.
