To reduce the risk of type 2 of diabetes 
 Achieve a [healthy body mass index](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html). Obesity is a strong risk factor for diabetes; losing even a few pounds can help prevent type 2 diabetes.
-   Increase [physical activity](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pregnancy/index.htm) to 30 minutes a day, at least 5 days a week. You can break up your activity into smaller chunks of time—for example, a brisk 10-minute walk 3 times a day.
-   Make [healthy food choices](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/eat-well.html). Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, limit fat intake to 30% or less of daily calories, and limit portion size to help improve weight loss and prevent type 2 diabetes.
